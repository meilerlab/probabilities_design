## Rosetta code
The Rosetta source code can be found at https://github.com/RosettaCommons/rosetta/. An overview of features implemented in this paper is given at https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/scripting_documentation/RosettaScripts/composite_protocols/Working-with-PerResidueProbabilitiesMetrics and a specific tutorial can be found at https://meilerlab.org/rosetta-workshop-2023/ (“Tutorial 2: Machine Learning in Rosetta”). Docker containers for Rosetta (including the Tensorflow/LibTorch extras version) can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/rosettacommons/rosetta.
